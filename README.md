Media Player that can play multiple videos/images at once in sync. Easily drag and drop media to rearrange them on a grid.

Use online for free here (or download the release for local version) https://whatdreamscost.github.io/MediaSyncer/

<b>Hotkeys:<b> SPACEBAR to Play/Pause, Left/Right Arrows to move to Previous/Next Frame. Drag to rearrange media. Scroll to Zoom. Click and Drag Middle Mouse Button to pan while zoomed in.

<b>PLEASE NOTE:<br><b>
This project was made using AI.<br>
This tool is very lightweight and does not handle multiple large files well. Don't expect it to work smoothly for running a bunch of 4k videos in sync. I mainly made it so I can quickly compare AI generations to see which settings are the best.
